		<h1>Questions</h1>
		Hi! My all favourite teachers. How are you all? Specially Manvi Ma'am and Prerna Ma'am. How are you all doing? How is your job going on? Is everything good? Hope you all are doing good.
	    I am asking these questions as you all are my favourite teachers. I am privately sending this link of my website so that you all can see my website and you can connect with me easily. Manvi Ma'am and Prerna Ma'am, I am creating this page to only tell you all that I am missing you all and I want to talk to you all. I remember that we only met in the last time in 26th March, 2025 when I was having my last paper of my board exam. When I was distributing sweets than only I met with you. It has been over 5 months when I have not met with you. For you both, I have created this page separately. I want my respect to show you all. You both were my favourite teachers. In class 9th, Prerna Ma'am was my favourite teacher in session 2023-2024. In class 10th, you were my favourite teacher in session 2024-2025. I will never forget you all. Due to your support, I have scored 81% in High school which was unexpected. Now I have left CMS and joined Modern Academy Viram Khand Branch due to subject reason and security reasons. You all Know that I was being bullied at school so I left it but I am not happy in this school as I am missing Manvi Ma'am and Prerna Ma'am.
